Aerosols, air pollution and the pandemic

#### Abstract
Changes in Spatiotemporal Precipitation Patterns in Changing Climate Conditions

Atmospheric aerosols and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are strongly affecting human health and climate in the Anthropocene, i.e., in the current era of globally pervasive and rapidly increasing human influence on planet Earth. Understanding the formation and transformation mechanisms of aerosols are key to developing mitigation strategies of aerosol pollution, climate change and the disease transmission. Here, I will take about recent advances that my group has made on the understanding of atmospheric reactive nitrogen chemistry and airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and how the advance of understanding would help policymakers to optimize the control strategies.
